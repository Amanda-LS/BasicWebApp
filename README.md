# [Amanda's App]
[Hello and welcome to Amanda's App! The purpose of it is to enable users the ability to make basic calculations using functions such as addition, multiplication,and exponential. The user has the option of inputting two numbers and choosing with function best fits their calculation needs. Once a function has been chosen, they will be directed to the results page where they will find a button that says click for results. When they click the button, the answer to the selected calculation will then generate. In addition to this, there is a special button which will take the user to a subpage where smiley and friend faces will print depending on the number the user has inputted. If a user does not need to make a calculation, they have the option to use the app for fun by clicking on the view featured vehicles button. If the button has been selected, it will then pull up different vehicle categories that the user can choose from. Depending on the category they select, an image of a featured vehicle will show on the page.]
